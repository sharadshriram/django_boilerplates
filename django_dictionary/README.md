Dictionary Application

    Django Skills Practiced: Rapid Prototyping

For this project, you will design a dictionary app that allows users to input a word and find the meaning of the word. To enhance the functionality, you can incorporate examples in a sentence as well as synonyms and antonyms. An application programming interface (API) will be very useful in this project.
